# 👋 Hi there, I’m Vivek Reddy  

# 👋 Hi, I’m Vivek Reddy  

I’m a **Full-Stack Software Developer** with 3+ years of professional experience building scalable and impactful software solutions across fintech, healthcare, and freelance domains.  

My journey started with a strong engineering foundation at **BITS Pilani**, where I explored IoT, embedded systems, and data-driven applications. Over the years, I’ve worked in **fast-paced startups** and **client projects**, contributing to products that reached thousands of users.  

I thrive in environments where I can design **end-to-end solutions** — from crafting clean, responsive user interfaces to engineering reliable backends and optimizing databases for performance. I’m especially interested in **API-driven platforms, cloud-native applications, and analytics dashboards** that turn data into actionable insights.  

Currently, I’m pursuing a **Master of Information Technology at RMIT University, Melbourne**, where I’m sharpening my expertise in software engineering, cloud computing, and data analytics. Alongside academics, I continue building projects and freelancing, applying what I learn in real-world scenarios.
